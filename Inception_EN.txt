Introduction
This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker.
You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual machine.

General guidelines
• This project need to be done on a Virtual Machine.
• All the files required for the configuration of your project must be placed in a srcs folder.
• A Makefile is also required and must be located at the root of your directory.
It must set up your entire application (i.e., it has to build the Docker images using docker-compose.yml).
• This subject requires putting into practice concepts that, depending on your background, you may not have learned yet.
Therefore, we advise you not to hesitate to read a lot of documentation related to Docker usage,
as well as anything else you will find helpful in order to complete this assignment.

Mandatory part
This project consists in having you set up a small infrastructure composed of different services under specific rules.
The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine.
You have to use docker compose.
Each Docker image must have the same name as its corresponding service.
Each service has to run in a dedicated container.
For performance matters, the containers must be built either from the penultimate stable version of Alpine or Debian. The choice is yours.
You also have to write your own Dockerfiles, one per service. The Dockerfiles must be called in your docker-compose.yml by your Makefile.
It means you have to build yourself the Docker images of your project.
It is then forbidden to pull ready-made Docker images, as well as using services such as DockerHub (Alpine/Debian being excluded from this rule).
You then have to set up:
• A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.
• A Docker container that contains WordPress + php-fpm (it must be installed and configured) only without nginx.
• A Docker container that contains MariaDB only without nginx.
• A volume that contains your WordPress database.
• A second volume that contains your WordPress website files.
• A docker-network that establishes the connection between your containers.
Your containers have to restart in case of a crash.

-i-
A Docker container is not a virtual machine.
Thus, it is not recommended to use any hacky patch based on ’tail -f’ and so forth when trying to run it.
Read about how daemons work and whether it’s a good idea to use them or not.

-!-
Of course, using network: host or --link or links: is forbidden.
The network line must be present in your docker-compose.yml file.
Your containers musn’t be started with a command running an infinite loop.
Thus, this also applies to any command used as entrypoint, or used in entrypoint scripts.
The following are a few prohibited hacky patches: tail -f, bash, sleep infinity, while true.

-i-
Read about PID 1 and the best practices for writing Dockerfiles.

• In your WordPress database, there must be two users, one of them being the administrator.
The administrator’s username can’t contain admin/Admin or administrator/Administrator (e.g., admin, administrator, Administrator, admin-123, and
so forth).

-i-
Your volumes will be available in the /home/login/data folder of the host machine using Docker.
Of course, you have to replace the login with yours.

To make things simpler, you have to configure your domain name so it points to your local IP address.
This domain name must be login.42.fr. Again, you have to use your own login.
For example, if your login is wil, wil.42.fr will redirect to the IP address pointing to wil’s website.

-!-
The latest tag is prohibited.
No password must be present in your Dockerfiles.
It is mandatory to use environment variables.
Also, it is strongly recommended to use a .env file to store environment variables.
The .env file should be located at the root of the srcs directory.
Your NGINX container must be the only entrypoint into your infrastructure via the port 443 only, using the TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 protocol.

Below is an example of the expected directory structure:

-!-
For obvious security reasons, any credentials, API keys, env variables etc... must be saved locally in a .env file and ignored by git.
Publicly stored credentials will lead you directly to a failure of the project.

Bonus part
For this project, the bonus part is aimed to be simple.
A Dockerfile must be written for each extra service.
Thus, each one of them will run inside its own container and will have, if necessary, its dedicated volume.

Bonus list:
• Set up redis cache for your WordPress website in order to properly manage the cache.
• Set up a FTP server container pointing to the volume of your WordPress website.
• Create a simple static website in the language of your choice except PHP (Yes, PHP is excluded!).
For example, a showcase site or a site for presenting your resume.
• Set up Adminer.
• Set up a service of your choice that you think is useful.
During the defense, you will have to justify your choice.
-i-
To complete the bonus part, you have the possibility to set up extra services.
In this case, you may open more ports to suit your needs.

-!-
The bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is PERFECT.
Perfect means the mandatory part has been integrally done and works without malfunctioning.
If you have not passed ALL the mandatory requirements, your bonus part will not be evaluated at all.
